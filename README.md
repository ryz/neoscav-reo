## Why this mod? ##

While the early-game of Neo Scavenger is nicely balanced, it tends to get too easy later in the game.
The original game is way to easy when certain ability combinations are selected and after DMC Sprawl/inner DMC is accessible, in my opinion.
At this point indefinite survival is almost a given; without too much struggle even.

This boils down to a few (game balance) factors, mainly:
* Crucial survival items don't or degrade too slowly
  * Sleeping bags, Sauce Pans, Small Parts, Rags.. none of these items degrades
  * Some items like the patchwork tunic degrade, but can be dis- and then re-assembled to circumvent degradation
* DMC (even the sprawl) gives the player easy and cheap access to all possible needs
  * Junk Mart's assortment is anything but junk; Some of the best items can be easily acquired here and it restocks every night.
  * The Last Chance Canteen offers cheap meals that make scavenging for food obsolete
  * Electricity is free and infinite
* Most actions are free and fail-proof
* Money is easily acquired and can't be lost by any means
* Major NPC action is (way too much) centered around the outskirts of DMC
  * NPCs regularily at the hands of the DMC guards and leave very valuable loot right at Junk Mart's footsteps
* Lots of other minor things
